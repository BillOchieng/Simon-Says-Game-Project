## Beep Boop; Beep Boop; BRR BRR BRR

- The Simon game project is an interactive web-based application that replicates the classic electronic game of memory skill. In this game, players are challenged to follow an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds. With each turn, the game adds one element to the sequence, and the player must replicate the sequence without mistakes. The game utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface where players interact with colored buttons on the screen.

# Here's a detailed description of the project

## Project Overview

**Title: Web-Based Simon Game**
**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

*Game Mechanics:*

- The game consists of four colored buttons, each producing a specific tone when activated or clicked.
- At the start of the game, the system randomly selects one of the buttons to light up and plays the corresponding sound.
- Players must remember the sequence and replicate it by pressing the buttons in the correct order.
- With each successful round, the sequence becomes longer by one, making the game progressively more challenging.
- If a player fails to reproduce the sequence correctly, the game ends, and a "game over" sound is played. The player is then prompted to start a new game.

*Features*

- *Interactive UI*: The game's interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use, with large, colorful buttons that visually and audibly respond to interactions.
- *Dynamic Difficulty*: The game's difficulty increases with each turn, testing the player's memory and concentration skills.
- *Sound Effects*: Each button has its own unique sound that plays when the button is activated, enhancing the sensory experience of the game.
- *Score Tracking*: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of successfully completed sequences, displaying the current points on the screen.
- *Restart Capability*: Players can start a new game at any time by pressing a "start" button, allowing for quick retries after a loss.

*Development Considerations*

- *Modular JavaScript*: The game logic is encapsulated in functions that handle game turns, button activation, sound playback, and sequence validation to keep the code organized and maintainable.
- *Responsive Design*: CSS is used to ensure the game's layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- *Accessibility*: Efforts are made to make the game accessible, including clear visual cues for active buttons and potentially adding keyboard controls for improved accessibility.

*Project Goals*

- The primary goal of this project is to create a fun and engaging web-based version of the Simon game that challenges users' memory skills. Additionally, the project aims to demonstrate proficiency in front-end web development technologies and practices, including responsive design, interactive JavaScript, and user experience design.

- This project serves both as an entertaining game for users and as a showcase of web development skills, including client-side scripting, HTML structure, and CSS styling.
